# Code Quality Standards

## General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep README files up to date
- Use docstrings or JSDoc comments

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new code
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Run tests before committing changes

## Security
- Validate all inputs
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
- Use secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated

## Performance
- Optimize algorithms and data structures
- Avoid unnecessary computations
- Use caching when appropriate
- Monitor and profile performance
